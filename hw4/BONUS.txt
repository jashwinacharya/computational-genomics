Discussion:

the variable region 4 seems to be closest to the tree for all 16s tree
I used my hw3 program to generate the newick files and then use iTol to visualize it

I expected region 4 to be closest because it seemed to be a lot longer than region 1. I didnt really
exprect region 1 to generate a very good tree. And I was correct. The tree that iTol generated only had a couple branches compared to
the tree generated for the 16s and region 4. This makes sense because region 4 is longer than region 1 and encompasses more base pairs
